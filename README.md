# BlackjackSim

## About the Project

**BlackjackSim** is a Java-based blackjack simulator built to explore advanced software architecture and modern Java features. It models a full blackjack game cycle — including deck management, player actions, dealer logic, and event-driven game flow — with a focus on clean design patterns and testability.

The project serves as both a **learning tool** and a **simulation framework**:
- 🎮 Run live games with colorized console output for immersive play.
- 🧠 Analyze strategies over thousands of simulated rounds.
- ⚙️ Experiment with design patterns like Command, EventBus, and Strategy.
- 🚀 Explore JVM performance tuning, modular design, and testing best practices.

> Built with **Java 25**, **Maven**, and **JUnit 5**, this project emphasizes maintainability, extensibility, and real-world engineering practices.

## 🧱 Current Development

I’m currently working on the **console implementation** of the game — focusing on interactive gameplay, clean event-driven output, and colorized log formatting using Log4j2.  
This phase aims to create a more dynamic and intuitive play experience directly in the terminal before extending to additional interfaces (e.g., simulation dashboards or graphical UIs).

## ▶️ Running the Application

You can launch the console simulation directly from the main entry point:
